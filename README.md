# 🎓 Student Course Feedback & Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes structured student feedback collected through numerical ratings.
The objective is to evaluate overall student satisfaction, identify strengths of the course,
and highlight areas for improvement using data-driven analysis.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains student ratings across multiple course evaluation parameters such as:
- Subject knowledge
- Clarity of explanation
- Assignment difficulty
- Student support
- Course recommendation

All ratings are recorded on a numerical scale.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- EDA

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Calculation of overall satisfaction score
- Visualization of rating distributions
- Comparison of average ratings across parameters
- Correlation analysis between feedback metrics

## 📈 Key Insights
- Teaching clarity and subject knowledge receive consistently high ratings
- Assignment difficulty shows relatively lower satisfaction
- Course recommendation is strongly influenced by teaching effectiveness

## 📌 Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how structured feedback data can be effectively used to
measure satisfaction levels and guide improvements in course design and delivery.

## 📷 Visualizations
Screenshots of key visualizations are included to support the analysis.
